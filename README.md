# Tetris-Game
Followed a YouTube Tutorial to make a Tetris game

There are multiple bugs in the game that need to be addressed
  As of now the game does not end and the blocks just keep on coming down
  Add a game over screen
  There are no sounds so potentially add sound
  No Mute Button
  No Pause button
  The game isn't keeping track of high score or the current score
